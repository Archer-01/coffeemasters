# Coffee Masters

Welcome to Coffee Masters, a frontend single-page application (SPA) created using Vanilla JavaScript! This project showcases my exploration of various JavaScript features, including a custom router, the utilization of JavaScript's web components, and delving into reactive programming through proxies.

## Features

-   **Custom Router**: I implemented a custom router in JavaScript, allowing for efficient navigation within the SPA. This provides a seamless user experience while maintaining the simplicity of a single-page application.

-   **Web Components**: Leveraging JavaScript's web components, this project demonstrates the modularization of UI elements. Each component encapsulates its functionality, promoting reusability and maintainability.

-   **Reactive Programming with Proxies**: Explore the power of reactive programming in JavaScript using proxies. Through this project, I gained insights into creating responsive and dynamic user interfaces by leveraging the capabilities of proxies.
